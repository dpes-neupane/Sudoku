# Sudoku
This is the solver that can mostly solve the soduku boards - I think. This was done sometime ago. And some of the idea like backtracking I found on the internet and is recursive. So, not a time efficient problem but an easier way to solve the problem. I'm sure there are better ways to do this.
You have to manually put the problem table into the script and then only it will solve the problem. It will not work for the boards that are not solvable.
The game's rules can be learned through various sites. I found it very boring to fill the table by myself, so I copied the problem board from the internet.

To visualize the solver, the __board.py__ will let you visualize the board 

And the __pygame__ module must be installed as well.
